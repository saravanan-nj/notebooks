            " It started when five people agreed to spend one night in a haunted house . . . What began as an evening of fun a harmless scares in exchange for one million dollars to anyone who stayed the night--and survived--soon turned into a night of terror. Years later, several more people risk their lives in search of a cursed statue of Baphomet, a relic worth millions that will come at the cost of their souls. Now, the terror begins when the doomed Return to House on Haunted Hill 8 Years have passed since Sara Wolfe and Eddie Baker escaped the House on Haunted Hill. Now the kidnapped Ariel, Sara's sister, goes inside the house with a group of treasure hunters to find the statue of Baphomet, worth millions and believed to be the cause of the House's evil. The editor of a fashion magazine Ariel Wolfe receives many calls from her sister Sara, but she does not return. When Sara is found dead, apparently after committing suicide, Ariel goes to her apartment with her friend and photographer Paul. She meets Professor Richard, who is seeking Sara's journal to find a lead to the statue of the evil god Baphomet for a museum. Later, Ariel and Paul are kidnapped by the gang of the treasure hunter Desmond, who intends to find and sell the statue to a private collector for five million dollars. They go to the house, where they meet Richard, his assistant Kyle and the student Michelle, but the criminals dominate the group. However, the house suddenly closes all the exits and they find trapped inside with vision of ghosts that are reliving their final moments in the place they died. The death of the haunted house's survivor Sarah, apparently by suicide, is the starting point for different ways to lead to following back onto haunted hill using her diary. Her sister seeks the truth but bumps into treasure hunters, who stop at nothing to get inside in search of the fabulously valuable statue of the evil god Baphomet, the legendary source of its evil. Only college professor-relic hunter's assistant Kyle has pure motives too, while the evil awakes, sparing nobody.\n",

The documentary also includes interviews with activists and allies from Ukraine, Canada and Germany, as well as footage from KyivPride events in 2012, the successful march in 2013, and to the cancellation of the 2014 march. During Toronto's Pride Week, four representatives of Ukraine's KyivPride visited World Pride and the World Pride Human Rights Conference in Toronto to share the strength of their commitment for securing fundamental human rights of LGBT people. The story of KyivPride inspired Canadian documentary filmmaker, photographer, and trans* activist, Michelle Emson to create the original film \"The Pride of Ukraine - Inspire a World of Change\". \"The goal of the documentary is to give hope,\" - says the film's director, Michelle Emson. \"Hope to motivate people all over the world to see the possibilities and to \"Inspire a World of Change\" so that LGBT people are safe from persecution and free to simply exist for who they are and love who they chose, wherever they might live in the world\". In spite of the troubles in Ukraine, the subject of LGBT rights must be maintained. It is not unusual for such rights to be compromised following changes of government and leadership. The new documentary is going to raise awareness about the LGBT rights question in Ukraine in Canada, the US and in Europe. \"The Pride of Ukraine - Inspire a World of Change\" is a project of KyivPride Canada, the new organization lead by both Canadian and Ukrainian human rights advocates. The crew consists of Ukrainian, German and Canadian filmmakers that worked together to create a clear story of the KyivPride. \"We are very excited about the documentary since it is going to be the first ever high quality, full story about our fight for LGBT Pride in Ukraine\" - says Olena Semenova, the Ukrainian activist, \"this story remains untold at this point and represents an important asset in.

However, above one of the city's villas, once a week in the evening the stars of hope sparkle, if only for a few minutes. This short time gives fresh heart to those hiding here and kindles hope in their tortured souls to live for another day. This mysterious power is none other than a beautiful song that can be heard at such times from the villa's tower room. Géza Halász, the villa's always jovial caretaker, believes no Jew has reason to fear while the owner of the voice, Imre Rose, the world-famous opera singer and a Jew himself, remains in Budapest and does not flee from the country in spite of his American, British, Swiss, Swedish and Vatican connections. Halász visits the singer every Friday to dine with him. After a while the marvellous, hope-inspiring concert starts, which is listened to by the hiding inhabitants of the house with enraptured faces through the villa's open dumb waiter. Already in the \"palmy years of peacetime\" Rose had competed with Csortos, the famous actor, for the title of \"Budapest's Greatest Misanthrope\". Thus it does not surprise anybody that the eccentric singer never, not even once, tries to make contact with his fellow Jews who took refuge in his house. And when Halász recounts that the singer swore within an hour of the Arrow Cross's seizing power that he would not utter a single word nor cross the threshold of his tower room until \"Andrássy Avenue has been purged of this Arrow Cross scum\", even the slightest suspicion about Rose's \"invisibility\" vanishes. Only a fourteen-year-old boy, Tommy, the caretaker's son, listens to the weekly song with curiosity combined with suspicion, and tries to find out about the secret of the tower room. As a result of the adolescent. This instance will be ignored in loss calculation. Note, if this happens often, consider increasing the `max_seq_length`.\n",

After a long, treacherous journey stowed away in a dark hull of an overcrowded cargo ship, Yin Yin arrives in New York City for what she thinks will be the beginning of a better life. Falsely promised a job in the technology industry, her dreams are shattered when she is told by the Snakeheads, an Asian gang, that her debt is much higher than expected. To pay off that additional debt she will have to work it off by being a prostitute. Yin Yin is devastated by the news that she is being sold into the sex slave trade. The rundown, decrepit building that Yin Yin and the other prostitutes live and work in is known as the Shanghai Hotel. Women from Thailand, Korea and China all reside in the Shanghai Hotel. Some of the women know what they are there for but most are just like Yin Yin, unwilling participants forced to sell their bodies. Upon arriving at the Shanghai Hotel, Yin Yin is isolated and locked in a room all by herself. The room has many windows, but the glass is spray painted black so that no one can see in or out. One window though is missing and is covered with just black tape. Yin Yin lifts the tape and has her only view of freedom and the outside world, the streets of New York City. While staring out the window, Yin Yin notices a bike messenger who is giving some food and blankets to the homeless people across the street from the Shanghai Hotel. She can tell that he is a kind-hearted person and decides to try and communicate with him. She gets his attention and passes him a note. The note tells of her horrible situation, but pleads with him not to tell anyone for fear of what repercussions the Snakeheads might take on her family in China. She ends the note by saying all she really needs is a friend. The bike messenger, named Carlos (Hill Harper), accepts her invitation. This instance will be ignored in loss calculation.

Taking an experimental drug for his epilepsy, manufactured by the Pfenal corporation, Adam begins suffering from seizures, black outs and terrifying visions. When he wakes up in a hotel room in Mexico missing a kidney, Adam becomes convinced that he's unwittingly stumbled into the middle of a conspiracy. Drugged by mysterious paramedics, Adam finds himself back in his London flat. Just as he assumes it's just been a bad dream, the pain of a scar on his back serves to convince him that something dark and disturbing is indeed happening. Worse still, Adam's one friend at work, Tracey, informs him that he's been missing from work for a week and as a result he's been fired.

With his reality becoming more and more fractured, and unable to trust anyone - let alone himself - Adam sets about trying to uncover the truth about the mysterious drug company Pfenal. The transatlantic connection seems ever more prominent in solving the mystery. Will he escape his torment and be united with his beloved Lily, and if so, at what cost? Just as he finally feels that he is able to rid himself of the ordeal of his medication, Adam finds himself confronted by two of the drug company's agents. And the reality of his situation turns out to be worse than his wildest conspiratorial nightmares. EMR weaves together a host of urban myths: from kidney-stealing, and alien-abduction, to manipulative drug corporations, this is a paranoiac's wonderland that winds its way, Rubik's cube-like, to its climax.\n",

Harriet is different from the others, as she owns a great creativity and has nobody to play with. Her infinite world exists only in her mind. One day, Ricky comes along. He is a grown-up, but intellectually disabled son of an elderly lady. Soon, Harriet and Ricky share their experiences of life from a different point of view and become close friends. But his mother still plans to give Ricky away into professional care in a home, because she won't live forever to be there for him.\n",

            " The Way of Glass is about a troubled college kid, Sophie (Frances Pabón), who thinks she has found a new path, a new teacher, an escape. We follow her home on a pilgrimage, first to see her ambitious, academic boyfriend, Keith (Michael Sutherland), and then to the apartment lousy with ghosts where her older brother, Daniel (Kai Issey) is locked in an uneasy truce with their overbearing mother, Marcy (Rachel Marcus). Young Sophie and her brother grew up in a household run by vaudevillian actors who tended to believe that all problems could be remedied by a tangerine or a bowl of consecrated chicken soup. The two siblings could not find a better match than one another to share their woes, their spiritual and social alienation, their cross-bearing egotism and their insufferable superiority complexes. But Daniel, a bit older and wiser, has been in this game a few extra years, while Sophie is still just a grasshopper. The story is narrated and directed by an omniscient older brother, Teddy (Theodore Bouloukos), a charming writer, teacher and sage of sorts who walks through their lives with a survivor's sense of remorse, nostalgia and fortitude. Overshadowing the story and the heart of the family is the wake of its messianic firstborn kin who, though no longer with them, has never been more present. Don't be misled; though rife with harsh words, piercing discord and cynical tirades, the Glass tale is-without question-a \"compound, or multiple, love story, plain and complicated.\" Based on the words of a great American author, and re-imagined by a team of innovative, young filmmakers, The Way of Glass conjures up a stunning visualization of a classic, cherished story.\n",

One day Laura's energetic friend Merit invites her on a hike to a bog led by a middle-aged nature-lover called Joosep. The beginning of the trip is anything but promising: the relation- ship between the reserved girl and the outgoing Joosep, who tries to impress the hiking party with his hillbilly style and bizarre rituals, becomes tense. But much to her own surprise, Laura discovers that as the hike continues she is enchanted by the rugged charms of Joosep. The quest is coming to its irrefutable end and Laura has to decide whether a relationship with an older man is a mere step along the winding road towards becoming a woman or whether it is her very first love. It is a story about falling in love for the first time. For psychological reasons and because of societal norms, making decisions becomes much more difficult - especially if the feelings that are awakening are directed towards an older man.\n",

His servant and friends still worship him but don't care much for his wife Sylvaine's second husband Gustave with whom she has recently had a child. Sylvaine's friends recommend that she use a new hairdresser, Leopold Trebel. However, when this womanizing coiffeur arrives, he turns out to be Adolphe suffering from amnesia. A doctor restores his memory using hypnosis but in the process wipes out everything that has happened to him over the last five years. Adolphe thinks he has been unconscious for only a few hours and the doctor tries to keep the truth from him thinking the shock could kill him. This becomes even more difficult as Leopold's wife, with whom he has had two sets of twins, shows up and insists he is Leopold. Gustave finally tells Adolphe/Leopold the truth and he is left with the decision of which man and in which family he wants to be.\n",

            " The movie is based on the Shakespearean tragedy 'Pericles. Prince of Tyre' and maintains the original language of the text. The story takes place in a green area delimited by highways. A group of immigrants and homeless wake up at dawn. Gower starts the interpretation of the text of Shakespeare, which it will be carried out almost until the end by the same group of people living in this surreal garden of Eden. The story is the dream of the little girl Marina, who lives with his father, Pericles, who is dying, in a post-atomic society. The film is a metaphor of the crisis of the role of the father in Western Society. When Pericles discovers the dread answer to Antioch's riddle, he flees for his life straight into famine, shipwreck, love, fatherhood, and another shipwreck; he loses his wife and daughter, and doesn't find them again until the story moves us through resurrection, attempted murder, pirates, prostitution, and divine revelation.\n",

Afterward, we see the stars relaxing from their hard work: Gregory Peck plays soccer with island schoolboys, while Gia Scala and Irene Papas patronize the local shops.

This film attempts to chronicle that experience through those same female eyes. While subject to the same physical hardships as men, these women do not dwell on that. Instead, they speak of camp families and faith, uplifting one another while trying to remain human. It was this path of spiritual resistance that, while not responsible for their direct survival, led to their ability to survive with healthy minds and spirits despite the constant barrage of their surroundings. Swimming in Auschwitz gives us a perspective of the camp, its surroundings and the Holocaust that we need to understand and remember, so that we never forget.\n",

When biologist Maria Wagner from East Berlin crosses the Hungarian border and feels Western soil under her feet for the first time in her life, her only desire is to travel to Paris as quickly as possible to see her daughter Theresa again after 15 years of separation. But their reunion in Paris is not as happy as Maria had hoped. Theresa, who has come to meet her mother at the Gare de l'Est, appears standoffish and not interested in this woman who has so suddenly entered her life. Gradually, Maria learns that her daughter has never got over the fact that, when she was 11 years old, her mother had entrusted her to the care of a stranger, French diplomat Gustave Durieux, who had taken her to Paris with him.

A documentary on everyday life in Tokyo, its KABUKI theater, its nostalgic TAKENOKOZOKU dances, its thousands of suit-and-tie executives, its geishas, its Western style marriages, its tranquil green areas, its pulsating nightlife... Yet, the commentary, which deliberately often strays away from the images, throws into question the objectivity of the documentary film. Here, what we see is inseparable from the experience of its young maker as he cast a loving eye on a people and its culture.

            " Once deemed, \"The most dangerous city west of the Santa Fe\", Los Angles was the original 'Wild West'. The incessant hankering of Americans to migrate west for profit and prosperity also brought with it, people who had a strong desire to find a place where they had the freedom to be themselves: in short, people in search of a better life. A true American virtue if ever one was, and Gays & Lesbians were no exception. Queer culture and it's history,is riddled with discrimination, suppression and despair; but also triumph and human spirit. And out of all of it emerged a unique identity and culture. But where did this culture come from? When and where did it begin to take shape? How has it evolved into what we see today? LAQH seeks to answer these questions by shedding light on a part of American history and historical figures who are largely unacknowledged, and in turn create a newfound dialogue about not only LGBTQ history, but how our Gay and Lesbian brothers and sisters effected the world we live in today; which will ultimately create a better understanding of the truly unique and utterly American culture of the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual & Transgender community. Most consider the NY Stonewall Riots of 1969 to be the birth of the Gay civil rights movement. But there have been activists, artists and innovators in L.A. since the turn of the 20th century. From the beloved male and female impersonators who graced the vaudeville stages of the early 1900's, to the Queer designers and artists behind the scenes who made Hollywood the glamour capital of the world, to the wide spread mid-century criminalization of Gays and Lesbians and the brave ones who began to fight back resulting in groundbreaking L.A. based organizations which sparked the Gay civil rights movement across the country and the world.\n",

It is estimated that over 400,000 people were imprisoned and 30,000 forcibly disappeared as a result of these government actions. In a letter to his son Pablo (Bernardo Peńa), Mendieta confesses the role he played in the abduction, persecution, and execution of countless men and women during his posting to Chile. Journalist Marco (Carlotto Cotta) and his pregnant wife Luciá (Carla Ortiz) are among those who were arrested, along with their activist friend Antonio (Tomás Fonzi) and revolutionary Andrea (Ana Calentano). They suffer terribly under Mendieta and his cohort Sanera (Rafael Ferro), which leads to a cascade of betrayals, secrets, and stolen lives that spans generations. Olvidados (Forgotten), Bolivia's Foreign Language Film submission for the 87th Academy AwardsŽ, stars renowned actors from five countries, and was filmed in Bolivia, Chile, and New York. It is the first film to specifically address the horrors perpetrated under Operation Condor, which was responsible for: 50,000 deaths; 30,000 \"disappeared\"; and 400,000 arrested and imprisoned in Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Paraguay, and Uruguay.\n",

            " George was born on 12 August 1762, the first son of George III and Queen Charlotte. He was made prince of Wales five days later. George III suffered a particularly violent bout of 'madness' in November 1788. The plots and political manoeuvring of the first 'regency crisis' lasted until February of the following year, by which time the prince seemed on the brink of becoming regent. Then, quite unexpectedly the king recovered. George was left completely exposed, looking like a cynical, heartless figure who had exalted in his father's distress and illness and tried to use this terrible national crisis to get himself into a position of power so that he could pay off his debts. When he died in 1830, at the age of 67, George joined the ranks of 'least loved' English monarchs. He wasn't a psychopath like Richard III, a serial wife-killer like Henry VIII, a cowardly usurper like King John. His crimes were relatively mild--he was profligate with the nation's money, he was thought to have mistreated his wife, and to have been rather too eager to take over from his poor, mad father, George III. And yet his obituaries were almost universally savage--'an odious beast', 'of all known beings the most selfish', and so on. Using dialogue based entirely on original sources (diaries, letters etc..) the film combines drama and documentary elements to tell George's story and to explain, from his perspective, how this intelligent, cultured and civilized man came to be painted in such monstrous terms.\n",

            " CSULB Professor Carlos Silveira, an artist educator and social activist, wants to bring a sense of joy to impoverished children in Cambodia who are affected by HIV/AIDS. He has recruited 27 American university students to join him as part of a pilot program in using drawing and painting to help these children express their wishes and desires for their futures. As Carlos and the students grapple with the realities of a culture much different from their own, a language they don't understand, art projects that don't go as planned and a three-week deadline, they form a bond with the children. Through these young Cambodian mentors-all of them abandoned by society-the Americans empower their own social activism and learn the true meaning of kindness, selflessness, courage and community. Told from Carlos' and six of his students' perspectives through a mix of spoken (voice-over) diary entries, interviews and interaction with the children as they create art projects together, this documentary shows that even the smallest attempt at making a difference can have life-changing consequences for all the people involved. The film also highlights the growing problem of the 77,000 children in Cambodia who have become orphans due to their parents dying from AIDS, a population expected to grow to 108,700 over the next five years. Yet, the audience is left with a sense of hope that adequate funding, proper food and medical care, as exemplified through the featured NGOs Little Sprouts and Little Folks, will allow these children to thrive until hopefully there is a cure for this unforgiving disease.\n",

Gathered in exuberant daily ritual around the great Egguilibrium mechanism, which is tended by the silent owl, Hasan, they unthinkingly trade their eggs for fruit.

            " College educated Hannah Swensen owns and operates Hannah's Cookie Jar, a bakery and café, in the small town of Eden Lake, Minnesota, where she grew up and where most everyone knows everyone else. Baking for the community and taking care of her cat are Hannah's primary concerns in life, while finding a husband by making herself more feminine being at the bottom of the list, which irks her widowed mother, Delores Swensen, and all the women in town who know Hannah is a catch if she would only show that side of herself. As such, Hannah does not appreciate Delores ambushing her with Dr. Norman Rhodes, the handsome bachelor dentist just arrived in town, despite admitting to herself that he is charming. Eden Lake is turned upside down when Hannah's childhood friend and the bakery's longtime dairy supplier delivery guy, Ron LaSalle, is found murdered outside the bakery, Hannah who finds his dead body behind the wheel of his delivery truck. Because the local police department is ill-equipped to handle a murder investigation, they call in Detective Mike Kingston of the Minneapolis PD to lead the investigation. As she finds Mike arrogant and because she doesn't trust him to know the ins and outs of Eden Lake in solving the murder of her friend, Hannah does some investigating of her own, while Mike does not appreciate an amateur sleuth interfering in the investigation. Hannah and Mike may have to come to a compromise and work together to find out who killed Ron.\n",

            " The life of Moses and the Biblical Exodus is one of the most told stories in human history. No one has ever pinpointed the exact year or even the correct century of these events, until now. A new theory claims to have concrete proof of the exact date of the Exodus as well as many other Biblical mysteries revealed. It is a grand tale of miracles and deliverance, cemented as the cornerstone of faith for both Judaism and Christianity. This project will explore a new theory seek out the truth told to and from scholars and professors whom are interested in debating the accuracy and validity of the new theory. This may very well become the most talked about documentary of the year. This film engages this conversation regarding a mystery that has perplexed biblical scholars and historians from around the world, for thousands of years. How could it be that this historic collision of civilizations cannot be confirmed through the records of Egypt? Did they really happen? Has there been a cover up? Have the stories been somehow misinterpreted or embellished over the passage of time? \"Engraved In Stone,\" challenges the question by asking if we have been looking in the wrong era. The evidence is plainly available, but until now no one has been able to put the puzzle pieces together. For the first time, we are able to piece together the true time-line of the Hebrew origins and know, based on actual Egyptian records plus confirmed in the Bible, the true date of the Exodus - 1174 BC.\n",

And all this time George's goal is to make enough money to be able to pay the dowry to Esther's parents. This way they can legitimize their marriage, and secure the future of their children.

            " Being Ozzy Osbourne is a different spin on the found-a-mind-portal-into-somebody's-brain formula made so popular by BJM. Greg is a semi-talented but listless sock puppeteer. His aggressively frumpy wife Dotte presses him to take a temp job at a mysteriously oblique shredding company called Howser Corp. Once there, he immediately falls in love with his mean-spirited coworker, an icy vixen named Maureen. Later that day, Greg discovers a cardboard portal behind the shredder which leads directly into the troubled, tripping mind of wobbly rock star Ozzy Osbourne. After five minutes, he's unceremoniously dumped onto Forest Lawn Drive next to the 134 Freeway. Greg tells Maureen, who quickly whips up a plan to sell tickets. Things happen fast in this short, loving homage to a great comedy. It culminates in a bizarre love triangle that explores the complexities of human behavior, the metaphysical implications of mind-inhabitation and just all-around logic-defiance. Shot over a weekend immediately after the November release of Being John Malkovich, this film made the rounds in Los Angeles before being made available to Internet audiences. The timing was set to coincide with the release of Being John Malkovich on DVD and video.\n",

Eric Krasno, Alan Evans and Neal Evans called on a multitude of their closest friends and musical conspirators to join them over the next fortnight - creating an incredibly broad guest lineup that included some of the preeminent guitar virtuosos of our generations (Derek Trucks, Warren Haynes, Charlie Hunter), some of the biggest names in Hip Hop (Questlove, Rahzel, Talib Kweli), and some of the most inventive improvisational players in modern rock n' roll (Robert Randolph, Raul Midon, Marco Benevento, Kofi & Oteil Burbridge). The Brooklyn Bowl quickly became the mecca for these distinct yet like-minded musicians, where they returned night and after to witness the magic unfolding, donning the dress code for good times (bowling shoes) and sharing famous Blue Ribbon fried chicken. The common thread that tied together all these disparate ingredients quickly became palpable - from the transcendental heartfelt improvisations onstage to the homey & playful atmosphere provided by the bowling alley, the Soulive residency was like nothing that had come before. All of these diverse elements fused to ultimately bring the Soul to Brooklyn Bowl.\n",

            " GREENHORN is a powerful film that gives human dimension to the Holocaust. It poignantly underscores our flawed humanity and speaks to the healing value of friendship. Greenhorn, adapted from the short novel of the same name, is based on the true story of an 11-year old Holocaust survivor named Daniel who arrives at a Brooklyn yeshiva in 1946. He is befriended by Aaron, a boy with a stutter, and the two of them stand up to the bullies who make fun of them, Aaron because of his stutter and Daniel because of the small box (his only possession), with its terrible secret that he wont let out of his sight. Daniel, the young survivor, rarely talks, but the narrator, a stutterer who bears the taunts of the other boys, comes to consider Daniel his friend. The mystery of what is in the box propels this short film, but it is in the complex relationships of the school boys that the human story is revealed. In the end, Aaron, the stutterer, finds his voice and a friend in Daniel, and their bond offers hope for a future life of dreams realized, one in which Daniel is able to let go of his box.\n",

            " \"Bionic Beauty Salon\" is a documentary engagement with the complexities of life in a female body, specifically the tragically common anxiety surrounding female body image. Driven by the need to address the insecurities in women of all ages who learn to place all of their self-worth in the measure of their beauty, \"Bionic Beauty Salon\" challenges the equation linking female physical strength and cosmetic beauty. In the process, it reveals the mechanics of glamor through which power is offered to young women. Six remarkable teenage girls speak about their struggles with this issue while a pair of perfect ruby lips dole out beauty tips from inside a compact's mirror, a surgeon performs liposuction on tapioca and jello, an ice cream sandwich sunbathes by the pool, and a grown woman searches for cosmetic counter salvation. Overseeing these struggles, the Bionic Woman, TV's first cyber-Barbie, recharges in luxury at her Bionic Beauty Salon, a toy marketed to TV-watching girls in the 70s. This project returns the gaze of anyone who has ever assessed the beauty of a woman.\n",

It opens with a spectacular 5 minute sequence, shot with 11 cameras, of the last commercial flight coming in to land at Rose Bay. The film draws on archival footage from the days when you could fly in luxury from London to Australia in just 5 days, touching down on the waters of Egypt, Arabia, Celylon and Indonesia on the way. It details the hard working \"flying porcupines\", Catalinas and Sunderlands that patrolled the North Sea and the Indian Ocean in WW2. It pays tribute to great navigators like P.G.Taylor who pioneered routes across the Pacific Ocean with Charles Kingsford Smith. And it investigates the business side of the industry, from the WW2 pilots who bought up mothballed aeroplanes for next to nothing, to the national behemoths who put the small operators out of business. Accompanied by the gorgeous music of Georg Philipp Telemann played by the Sydney Symphony Orchestra.\n",

He knows Manhattan like the back of his hand. His films are filled with a bevy of familiar Village characters: bar-hoppers and park-benchers, retirees and wanabees, the lonely and the beautiful. In ANGELA, his first Erotic Tale, Amos Kollek told a delightfully funny fairy tale about an ordinary guy aching for one last fling at the tender age of 70. In MUSIC he extends the metaphor to embrace a city that never sleeps - as though Manhattan at night is the very essence of the elusive, vulnerable woman. Spiced with surreal, Kafkaesque twists, MUSIC is about a man who loves music and is fascinated by the fair sex. But he is not quite sure why and how he has ended up in this strange hotel room ...\n",

While the film celebrates the achievements made by queer Anglicans as they fight to transform an oppressive Christian tradition into a modern force of liberation, it never excuses the prejudices and abuses of organized religion, particularly in an era when the word \"faith\" is merely code for the nationalistic and homophobic violence organized religion often fosters. As the film's devoutly Christian (and male) interviewees offer an internal critique of Christian patriarchy, the film ultimately implies that our best cure for homophobia should come from within the Church, the institution most responsible for propagating homophobia.\n",

Maureen Sullivan and two of her clients agreed to have the entire progression of their therapy taped, and what emerges is a disarming and compassionate look at the struggles people face in connecting with one another. Twenty-five-year-old Kipper is a virginal grad student who gets nervous just talking to a girl, let alone touching her, and John, at 45, is newly divorced and suffering from fears of sexual inadequacy. As Maureen attempts to build up their confidence, she also exposes her own doubts in this touching film that dismisses a clinical approach to sex.\n",

Five neighbourhoods will face off in the series finale which will air June 11, in the midst of the Stanley Cup playoffs. NHL commissioner Gary Bettman said the show was designed in part to reward Canadian hockey fans who remained devoted to the league through its tumultuous 10-month lockout - and to win back those who may have soured on the sport.\n",

            " Arthur Hawke works as a coal truck driver in Kentucky, he in the process trying to protect his widowed mother Sarah Hawke's property rights against his wealthy and cutthroat paternal uncles' mineral rights. Sarah, however, may be more astute in the matters of business than her son. In his spare time, Arthur is writing a novel under the pen name Youngblood Hawke, it, his first, which he is able to sell to a New York publishing house. As such, Arthur moves to New York City while he works on the necessary rewrites and contemplates his next novel, which he knows can and will pour out of him. Even before that first novel, Alms of Oblivion, is published, Arthur is the toast of certain literary circles in New York. Naive to the ways of the business, he gets caught up in this new life, in having to deal with the publishers, agents, managers, lawyers, critics, theater people who want him to translate the work into a play, and movie types who want to purchase the movie rights. He has to decide whose advice to follow in these matters, he potentially being overextended in he wanting to do and have it all. He does not realize until he is ensconced within this life that there was a latent passion associated with his work, the women around him who can smell it ooze off of him. The feminine advances for who he ultimately falls is that of Frieda Winter, a wealthy, married socialite and a frequent patron of the arts. In his affair with Frieda which needs to be hidden at every turn, Arthur may not yet realize that what he feels for his story editor, Jeanne Green, who initially discovered his unsolicited manuscript, is more than just professional gratitude. Through it all, Arthur may eventually come to the understanding that his standing in this world is solely judged on the success or failure of his latest work. Youngblood Hawke is a truck driver from Kentucky who comes to New York City to become a hot-shot writer. Almost immediately, he meets editor Jeanne Green. She sees great promise in Hawke's writing and falls for the handsome Kentuckian while helping him put together his first book. This instance will be ignored in loss calculation.

Perhaps taking this message a bit too seriously, Pete decides it's his goal for the summer to help someone get into heaven; having been told that Catholicism is the only sure path to the kingdom of the Lord, Pete decides to convert a Jew to Catholicism in order to improve their standing in the afterlife. Hoping to find a likely candidate, Pete begins visiting a nearby synagogue, where he gets to know Rabbi Jacobson, who responds to Pete's barrage of questions with good humor. Pete also makes friends with the Rabbi's son, Danny, who is about the same age; when he learns that Danny is seriously ill, he decides Danny would be an excellent choice for conversion. When the priest at Pete's church informs Pete that all will be tested before they pass the Pearly Gates, he sets up a mini-decathlon and puts Danny in training as he attempts to reshape his spiritual thinking. Pete's parents aren't sure just what to make of Pete's new summer project, and as they become acquainted with Rabbi Jacobson, they share their perspectives on the unexpected trials of parenting.\n",

            " \"Code Name: Butterflies,\" is the first documentary to tell the powerful story of the Mirabal sisters of the Dominican Republic. In the 1950s, Patria, Minerva and Maria Teresa Mirabal, who were known by their secret name of \"Butterflies,\" created a secret resistance movement against Rafael Leonidas Trujillo, one of the most bloodthirsty tyrants the world has ever known. When the dictator had them assassinated making it seem like an accident, the country rose up against Trujillo and a group of conspirators who had been plotting his death but had not dared to move forward, assassinated him. The courage of the Mirabals, simple wives and mothers who helped bring freedom and democracy to their country, is legendary. Today, the Dominican Republic owes much to these incredible women who were willing to sacrifice everything and to fight for what they believed in. The day of Mirabal sisters' death, November 25, has been designated by the United Nations as the \"Day of Non-Violence Against Women\" in their honor. The documentary interweaves interviews with witnesses to the story, including surviving Mirabal family members, their co-revolutionaries, teachers, friends, and colleagues, with dramatic recreations and archival footage and b-roll.\n",

The teachers talk to each other about their prospective students, both the good and the bad. The teachers collectively want to inspire their students, but each teacher is an individual who will do things in his or her own way to achieve the results they desire. They also have differing viewpoints on the students themselves, and how best to praise and discipline them. The administration of the school tries to be as fair as possible, which includes having student representatives sit on the student evaluation committee. Marin's class this year of fourteen and fifteen year olds is no different than previous years, although the names and faces have changed. Marin tries to get through to his students, sometimes with success and sometimes resulting in utter failure. Even Marin has his breaking point, which may result in him doing things he would probably admit to himself are wrong.

Between 1848 and 1975 this sparsely populated country was a Spanish dominion. After Franco's death and the quick retreat of the colonizers, the signing of the secret and illegal Madrid memorandum entitled Morocco and Mauritania to occupy Western Sahara, which led to the exodus of almost entire Saharan population. Some 70.000 people found shelter in refugee camps at the very south-western part of Algeria, around the town of Tindouf. The Saharans organized themselves politically and militarily in the Polisario Front and continue to struggle. In the meanwhile, new generations of Saharans have grown up in the refugee camps, which currently count some 180.000 people.\n",

Three young Inuit boys were separated from their families in the Arctic and were sent to Ottawa, the nation's capital, to live with white families and to be educated in white schools. The consequences the experiment would have on the boys, their identity and culture was brushed aside. The bureaucrats did not anticipate the outcome. The three grow up to be political activists and leaders - often at odds with the government that brought them south. They establish aboriginal rights in Canada and are instrumental in the creation of Nunavut, the world's largest self-governed aboriginal territory. But it all comes at a tremendous personal cost. Peter Ittinuar, Zebedee Nungak, and Eric Tagoona recount their stories, achievements and challenges in this film about an attempt at assimilation, empowerment, and the triumph of the human spirit.\n",

His trademark hare sculptures marked him out as an innovator and he once described himself as an English-speaking itinerant European sculptor. In this documentary, one-man filmmaker Peter Bach embarks on a personal journey by making a vow to Flanagan, who at the time is wrestling with motor neuron disease on the island of Ibiza, that he will travel the world and bring back footage of strangers by his public works and film the artist watching them as he wrestles with his disease.

            " For the past two hundred years, Aboriginal Australians have struggled to preserve their culture and identity while adapting to the modern world. But increasingly, Indigenous Australians have been engaging with that world, taking on leading roles in the community and securing an important place in industry by taking up the challenge of establishing their own business enterprises. The mining boom in Western Australia has driven a period of tremendous growth for the state, with virtually all sectors of commerce and industry benefiting as a result. It is an environment that has stimulated new business opportunities for those with ideas and initiative. Indigenous, In Business introduces six Aboriginal Australians who have taken advantage of that situation and, often with the support of the mining and government sectors made successful ventures into business for themselves.

But once he spots Brendan, he can't stop fantasizing about being with the sensuous, dark-haired man. However, Brendan's friends have their own ideas, and continue to pull him into their orgy of alcohol and sex. Finally alone at the pool, Brendan approaches Tommy and they spend an afternoon exploring the desert town and each other. Just as Tommy saves Brendan from a poolside accident, Brendan's friends come back - and try to force the two apart. True love conquers all, as Tommy's vacation climaxes in a passionate declaration of love and desire. LOVE INN EXILE boasts several unforgettable erotic scenes - including the strangely tender, drunken ménage a trois between Brendan's friends, a spicy tequila shot off Brendan's shoulder, and, of course, Tommy's ultimate fulfillment by his ideal man. LOVE INN EXILE is filmed entirely on location at Inn Exile in Palm Springs. With music by adult film star Sharon Kane, this video makes exile seem like a perfectly good punishment!\"\n",
